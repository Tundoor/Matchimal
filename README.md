# Matchimal
### Work In Progress

Matchimal is a "dating"  websites for dogs where you get to match your furry friend up with the Wuff of their life. It's based off a social media platform
with its like button so you can come back to the furry friend or you can message the owner of the animal and chat with the owner.

The technologies used is HTML, React and CSS. I make use of react router-router dom and a few other react dependencies.
